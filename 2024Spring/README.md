# 2024 NCATS Spring Coding Camp - New Format!

## Course Goals
The goal of the camp is to provide assisted learning in the use of NCATS public resources.  The camp is intended for beginner or seasoned computational experts, and no previous experience is required.

At the end of this course, participants will have been introduced to the following four resources and will have learned how to use them in their research.

- Rare Disease Alert System ([RDAS](https://rdas.ncats.nih.gov/)) –integrated, annotated, and standardized publication, funding, trial and epidemiological data related to rare disease data
- [Pharos](https://pharos.ncats.nih.gov/) – aggregated and harmonized data for targets (proteins), diseases and ligands that represent the most common druggable targets with an emphasis on understudied proteins
- Relational Database of Metabolomic Pathways ([RaMP-DB](https://rampdb.nih.gov/) – explore 254,860 chemical structures, of which 43,338 are lipids, 15,389 genes, 53,745 pathways, 807,362 metabolic enzyme/metabolite reactions, and 699 ontologies
- Global Substance Registration System ([GSRS](https://gsrs.ncats.nih.gov/)) & [Inxight Drugs](https://drugs.ncats.io/) – GSRS publishes 152,696 substances, manually curated and registered by the FDA, which is expanded on by Inxight Drugs to include activity data, adverse events, drug-drug interactions, toxicity, sourcing, publications, and application instructions

Please see more introductory information on these resources [here](https://github.com/ncats/IFX_Workshops_Tutorials/tree/main/202311_AMIA_Workshop/slides) and further information on their use [here](https://github.com/ncats/IFX_Workshops_Tutorials/blob/main/202311_AMIA_Workshop/README.md).
